        <p className="text-lg mb-6 text-gray-700">
          Welcome to <strong>Ecoshelf</strong>, a platform dedicated to the idea that books should have more than one life.
          We believe in sustainability and community, and that's why we created Ecoshelf: to provide a simple, eco-friendly way to exchange books and promote a culture of sharing.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-yellow-900">Our Mission</h3>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6 text-gray-700">
          At Ecoshelf, our mission is simple: to create a space where readers can donate and receive books, making literature more accessible while helping to reduce waste.
          We understand that books can be expensive, and once you’re done reading a book, it’s often left to collect dust on a shelf. Through our platform, we aim to connect people who are eager to share their beloved books and allow others to give them a second life.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-yellow-900">Our Story</h3>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6 text-gray-700">
          Ecoshelf was born out of a personal vision to make a difference in the way we approach book ownership. As someone who has always been passionate about reading, I realized how many books I had collected over the years, and it seemed wasteful to just let them sit idle. 
          I wanted to build a platform that would encourage people to pass along their books and offer them to others who may not be able to afford new ones.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6 text-gray-700">
          What started as a small personal project has grown into a community-driven platform where people can find books that align with their interests, donate books that they no longer need, and feel good about contributing to sustainability. 
          It’s a simple way to make a positive impact while continuing to enjoy the magic of books.
        </p>
